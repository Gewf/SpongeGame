### Who is Sponge?
First of all, Sponge is a fictional character that does not exist in the original Mario universe. It is a character created by the Vinesauce community.
Sponge is the lost Mario brother, the one noone knows of.  
His special power is to suck the depression from the levels with his mustache.  
This is why all the Mario games are always so happy.

### State of the game (right now):
The game is not finished yet. Some story between the levels is missing, and so is the last level (the castle).   
The 3 out of the 4 final levels are playable.
